## Fields of application for artificial intelligence

For generative AI, there is unfortunately not yet a nice diagram similar to the [AI Landscape of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence](https://ojs.aaai.org/aimagazine/index.php/aimagazine/article/view/2168) (AAAI) that shows **in which areas of our lives and work AI plays or can play a role**. On the Hugging Face platform, the [Classification of Models](https://huggingface.co/models) provides a categorization of fields of application for artificial intelligence, albeit a very technical one. McKinsey describes possible fields of application in the article [What's the future of generative AI?](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-%20explainers/whats-the-future-of-generative-ai-an-early-view-in-15-charts) in more detail:

As described in the **HBR article** [Where Should Your Company Start with GenAI?](https://hbr.org/2023/09/where-should-your-company-start-with-genai), organizations and all individual knowledge workers should find out whether and how their activities are affected by generative AI. The article suggests the WINS meme, which you can use to check how much effort your own activities involve in dealing with texts (Words), images (Images), numbers (Numbers) and audio (Sounds). The degree to which you are affected depends on the effort and degree of digitization in the respective activity.

If you do not have a **personal knowledge map with an overview of your tasks**, you can use the [categories of knowledge-intensive activities of the Federal Institute for Vocational Education and Training](https://lit.bibb.de/vufind/Record/DS-131131) as a starting point:

1. research
2. develop
3. research
4. documenting
5. training
6. teaching
7. organizing external work processes
